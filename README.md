# Encryption-Decryption-Using-a-Novel-C#-

# Purpose and Description
The purpose of this program is to gain practice and understanding in designing and implementing multiple classes in a complex program. 
The program demonstrates reading and modifying .txt files, manipulating strings, dictionaries, lists, and passing data between classes.
This program is designed to encode and decode messages by reading the novel "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen into a dictionary<string, <int>> data type. The dictionary
keys are the words in the novel, while the values are the # of times that word appears in the text. We will use this dictionary to encode messages by taking the message, identifying
the positions (index values) in the book where the words in the message appear, and creating the "encoded message" as the integer position representations of those words.
We will decode the messages by simply taking the integer representations and using them to locate and store the words they represent in the book.

# How to Use
To use this program, please ensure you have Visual Studio installed in addition to the .NET Desktop Development workload within Visual Studio. This program
uses a Windows form for the user, which has clear instructions and textboxes to display certain statistics and the different phases of encoding/ decoding the
desired message. Simply open the solution (.sln) file in Visual Studio and run the code to instantiate the Windows form.
